    <h2>Connections</h2>
    <p>
        An arrow points from parent to child.
        Most nodes will have two arrows pointing towards them,
        indicating two parents.
    </p>
    <h2>Color Key</h2>
    <h3><span style="background-color:yellow">God</span></h3>
    <p>Just normal gods.</p>
    <h3><span style="background-color:gold">Olympian</span></h3>
    <p>These are the 12 Gods considered to be Olympians, such as Zeus</p>
    <h3><span style="background-color:green">Titan</span></h3>
    <p>The Titans were the pantheon before the Olympians, such as Cronus, Father of Zeus</p>
    <h3><span style="background-color:cyan">Primordial</span></h3>
    <p>
        The Primordial gods existed before the Titans,
        but aren't considered to be a pantheon.
        Gaia is the mother of nist of the Titans.
    </p>
    <h3><span style="background-color:lightblue">River God</span></h3>
    <p>
        Most rivers had their own gods, which the rivers were named after.
        Most of the River Gods were the male children of Oceanus and Tethys.
    </p>
    <h3><span style="background-color:blue">Water Nymph</span></h3>
    <p>
        Water Nymphs are the female children of either River Gods or certain Titans.
        They inhabit non-river bodies of water.
        Achilles' mother, Thetis, is a water nymph.
    </p>
    <h3><span style="background-color:magenta">Hero</span></h3>
    <p>
        Heroes are people who are traditionally referred to as Greek heroes.
        This includes Hercules.
    </p>
    <h3><span style="background-color:orange">Divine</span></h3>
    <p>
        Divine is a descriptor I came up with to describe someone whos
        ancestry can be entirely traced back to gods. Many heros fall into this catagory.
    </p>
    <h3><span style="background-color:red">Mortal</span></h3>
    <p>
        Not everyone's a god, so there are mortals. When both parents were mortals,
        I didn't include the parents.
    </p>
    <h3><span style="background-color:darkred">Daemon</span></h3>
    <p>
        Daemons are lesser dieties or spirits. Most of the important ones
        are children of Styx (not the river) and Pallas, including Nike.
    </p>
    <h3><span style="background-color:black; color:white">Chaos</span></h3>
    <p>
        Chaos is a god/place/concept from which the first primordial gods
        came from. It gets its own catagory.
    </p>
    <h3><span style="background-color:gainsboro">Old</span></h3>
    <p>
        Old refers to the two gods that predate Chaos. The beginning of
        the universe is described as Ananke, the goddess of
        inevitability, crushing Chronos (not Cronus), the god of time.
    </p>

    <h2>Strange Connections</h2>
    <p>
        Not all gods are born in a normal way, ones that are particularly
        different are listed here.
    </p>
    <p>
        (— – —): Aphrodite appears in the foam produced from Uranus'
        severed genitals crashing into the ocean.
    </p>
    <p>
        (— – – —): Athena, fully grown and armored, bursts from Zeus'
        forehead
    </p>
    <p>
        (— – – – —): Hephaestus creates Pandora, the first mortal woman,
        from earth, and Athena clothes her
        (this is very important for some reason).
    </p>
    <h2>Things I Found Interesting</h2>

    <p>Zeus is the father, grandfather, and second cousin of Hellen of Troy.</p>
